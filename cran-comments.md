I've finally got round to addressing the issues flagged by CRAN's auto checks and available at https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2024/2024-11-18_check_results_pct.html Because I was slow to respond to these issues the package was removed from CRAN. I am now resubmitting.

I have checked the package via the winbuilder service and there are only false positive typos and URL issues that I cannot reproduce locally.

If there are any further issues please let me know and I can address, to help get the package back on CRAN.
